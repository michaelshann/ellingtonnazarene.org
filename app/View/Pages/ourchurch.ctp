	<h2>Agreed Statement of Belief:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In one Godâ€”the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li>The Old and New Testament Scriptures, given by plenary inspiration, contain all truth necessary to faith and Christian living.</li>
	<li>Human beings are born with a fallen nature, and are, therefore, inclined to evil, and that continually.</li>
	<li>The finally impenitent are hopelessly and eternally lost.</li>
	<li>The atonement through Jesus Christ is for the whole human race; and that whosoever repents and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ is justified and regenerated and saved from the dominion of sin.</li>
	<li>That believers are to be sanctified wholly, subsequent to regeneration, through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit bears witness to the new birth, and also to the entire sanctification of believers.</li>
	<li>Our Lord will return, the dead will be raised, and the final judgment will take place.</li>
</ul>
